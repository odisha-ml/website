# Deep Learning Revolution – Neural Networks Strike Back (2000s-2010s)

## 1  Introduction

By the late-1990s [machine-learning era](@/blogs/how-did-we-get-here/ml-era.md), data-driven models had broken expert-system bottlenecks, yet neural networks were still considered academic curiosities. Training stalled on shallow architectures; vanishing gradients and limited compute kept deep nets on the sidelines. Then, in the first decade of the 21 st-century, three forces converged—algorithmic breakthroughs, GPU acceleration, and web-scale data—catapulting “deep learning” from lab demos to the beating heart of modern AI. This chapter retraces that comeback, charting the milestones that made convolutions, ReLUs, and dropout household terms, culminating in ImageNet’s legendary upset and India’s own leap onto the DL stage.

## 2  Neural Networks Resurgence

### 2.1 From Perceptrons to Backprop—and Bust

The single-layer perceptron wowed the 1950s but fizzled when Minsky & Papert proved its limits. Multilayer perceptrons and back-propagation resurfaced in the 1980s, yet data scarcity and slow CPUs soon ushered in the second AI Winter.

### 2.2 2006: Hinton’s Deep Belief Networks

Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and colleagues unveiled **Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)**—a greedy, layer-wise unsupervised pre-training scheme that turned a stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machines into a deep classifier. The trick: initialize each layer close to a good region of the loss landscape, then fine-tune with supervised back-prop. [^1]

### 2.3 Technical Fixes

* **Vanishing-gradient remedies:** layer-wise pre-training, careful initialization, and later batch normalization.
* **Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs):** simple `max(0,x)` activations maintained healthy gradients and sped training. ([cs.toronto.edu][2])
* **Dropout:** randomly “dropping” neurons during training prevented co-adaptation and tamed overfitting. ([jmlr.org][3])

### 2.5 Code Sketch: Perceptron vs. Mini-Deep Net

```python
# Simple perceptron for XOR fails
import torch, torch.nn as nn, torch.optim as optim
X = torch.tensor([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1.]])
y = torch.tensor([[0],[1],[1],[0.]]).float()
perceptron = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2,1), nn.Sigmoid())
loss_fn, opt = nn.BCELoss(), optim.SGD(perceptron.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Two-layer net succeeds
deep = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2,4), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(4,1), nn.Sigmoid())
```

Try toggling `perceptron` ↔ `deep` to see how depth learns XOR in seconds. *Open in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/omitted/perceptron_vs_deep.ipynb).*

## 3  Big Data & GPUs – Fuel for Deep Learning

### 3.1 Data Explosion

Web 2.0 birthed forums, social feeds, and user-generated photos. By 2009, the **ImageNet** project had crowdsourced 14 million labeled images across 21 k categories, dwarfing prior vision datasets. [^4]

### 3.2 GPU Computing Revolution

NVIDIA’s 2007 **CUDA** SDK let researchers commandeer thousands of GPU cores from Python or C. Parallel matrix multiplies slashed model-training time by orders of magnitude and forged a moat around GPU-accelerated DL. ([businessinsider.com][5])

### 3.3 Cloud & Storage

Cheap AWS EC2 GPU instances (G2 in 2013) turned overnight training runs into lunchtime experiments. Hadoop, MapReduce, and later Spark pipelined terabyte-scale data into mini-batches.

{% end %}

### 3.5 Code Snippet: CPU vs GPU Benchmark

```python
import torch, time
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = torch.nn.Linear(4096,4096).to(device)
x = torch.randn(8192,4096, device=device)
start = time.time(); y = model(x); torch.cuda.synchronize(); print("Elapsed:", time.time()-start)
```

Expect ≈ 50 × speed-up on an RTX 4000-class GPU. *Open in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/omitted/cpu_vs_gpu.ipynb).*

## 4  Milestone Breakthroughs

### 4.1 ImageNet 2012: AlexNet

Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Hinton's **AlexNet** CNN halved top-5 error—from 26% to 15.3%—and won the ILSVRC 2012 challenge, igniting the CV gold-rush. [^6]

{% end %}

The revolutionary aspects of AlexNet included:
* **ReLU activations** instead of tanh, preventing vanishing gradients
* **Dropout regularization** to reduce overfitting
* **Two-GPU parallelism** (60M parameters)
* **Data augmentation** (crops, flips, color)
* First CNN to win ImageNet by a large margin


### 4.2 Speech Recognition

In 2012, Microsoft and U-Toronto showed deep nets shaving word-error by 20 % vs. Gaussian HMMs, paving the path for real-time on-device speech. [^7]
