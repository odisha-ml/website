### Summary

From Alan Turing‚Äôs provocative 1950 question *‚ÄúCan machines think?‚Äù* to the eight-week Dartmouth Workshop that officially christened **Artificial Intelligence** in 1956, this article traces the technical, philosophical, and human currents that sparked the AI revolution. You‚Äôll meet the first electronic computers, unpack the famed **Turing Test**, step inside the ‚ÄúConstitutional Convention of AI,‚Äù and re-create 1950s-style programs in Python. By the end, you‚Äôll see why those early dreams still underlie every prompt you write in 2025.

## Opening Hook

> *London, 1950.* A young mathematician named **Alan Turing** publishes a daring essay asking whether a machine could ever convince us it is human. Fast-forward to *Bhubaneswar, 2025*: an Odia developer pings GPT-4o‚Äôs API and gets a production-ready React scaffold in seconds. The seamless 21-st-century interaction flows directly from Turing‚Äôs ‚Äúimitation game,‚Äù proving that yesterday‚Äôs thought experiment is today‚Äôs workflow.([en.wikipedia.org][1])

Those six short years between **1950 and 1956**‚Äîfilled with glowing vacuum tubes, punch cards, and bold conjectures‚Äîseeded the entire field we now call AI. Let‚Äôs rewind and watch the sparks fly.

## Alan Turing and the ‚ÄúThinking Machine‚Äù (1950)

### ‚ÄúComputing Machinery and Intelligence‚Äù

In October 1950, Turing published *Computing Machinery and Intelligence* in **Mind**. He sidestepped definitional squabbles‚Äî*What is thinking?*‚Äîby proposing a behavioral benchmark: the **Imitation Game**, later dubbed the **Turing Test**.([en.wikipedia.org][1])

> ‚Äú*Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?*‚Äù ‚ÄîA. M. Turing, 1950.

#### The Test, Reimagined for Developers

Picture a black-box API test: you send JSON requests, inspect responses, and decide whether the endpoint is human- or machine-powered. That‚Äôs the Turing Test in spirit. Modern red-team evaluations of LLMs still follow this template, swapping telegram paper for chat logs. A 2025 UC San Diego study found **GPT-4.5** fooled judges **73 %** of the time‚Äîoutscoring real humans.([arxiv.org][2], [nypost.com][3])

#### Why It Was Revolutionary

* **Behavior over biology** ‚Äì intelligence became what a system *does*, not what it *is*.
* **Quantifiable goal** ‚Äì a testable milestone that researchers (and grant committees) could rally around.
* **Enduring relevance** ‚Äì every model leaderboard today measures some flavor of ‚Äúindistinguishability.‚Äù

> **Call-out ‚Äî *Why the Turing Test Still Matters***
> LLM benchmarks like **MT-Bench** and **MMLU** often boil down to one question: *Does this model‚Äôs answer feel convincingly human?* The Imitation Game lives on.

## Early Computers & AI Precursors

### From ENIAC to EDVAC

| **EDVAC (design)** | 1945 | **Stored-program** concept (Von Neumann)       | Logic could be changed in software ‚Üí cradle of AI ([historyofinformation.com][5]) |

The **von Neumann architecture**‚Äîone memory for instructions *and* data‚Äîlet researchers iterate on symbolic logic without touching soldering irons, a prerequisite for AI‚Äôs quick evolution.

> **Sidebar ‚Äî Von Neumann in Plain English**
> Imagine if your laptop‚Äôs code lived on a USB stick you had to swap for every function call. That was ENIAC. EDVAC‚Äôs stored-program idea shoved code and data onto the same SSD, unlocking `while` loops, recursion, and, eventually, AI.

### Birthplace of **Artificial Intelligence**

In summer 1956, four visionaries‚Äî**John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, Claude Shannon**‚Äîhosted the **Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence**. McCarthy‚Äôs proposal declared:

> ‚Äú*Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.*‚Äù([jmc.stanford.edu][6], [home.dartmouth.edu][7])

The eight-week workshop gathered mathematicians, psychologists, and engineers in Hanover, New Hampshire. Historians call it AI‚Äôs **‚ÄúConstitutional Convention.‚Äù**([en.wikipedia.org][8])

#### Key Personalities

| Name                    | Notable Later Achievements                                            |

| **John McCarthy**       | Coins ‚ÄúAI,‚Äù invents **Lisp**, wins Turing Award ([teneo.ai][9])       |
| **Marvin Minsky**       | Co-founder MIT AI Lab, author *Perceptrons* ([spectrum.ieee.org][10]) |
| **Claude Shannon**      | Father of Information Theory; chess-playing algorithms                |
| **Nathaniel Rochester** | Architect of IBM 701; pushed AI on mainframes                         |

The mood was exuberant: some predicted human-level AI in a decade. That optimism set research agendas‚Äîand funding expectations‚Äîfor years to come.([council.science][11], [computerhistory.org][12])

## First AI Programs & Early Successes

### The Logic Theorist (1956)

Developed at RAND by **Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and Cliff Shaw**, the **Logic Theorist** proved **38 of 52** theorems in *Principia Mathematica*, even discovering a shorter proof of Theorem 2.85.([historyofinformation.com][13])

#### How It Worked ‚Äì State-Space Search

```python
# simplified Logic Theorist in Python
rules = {("A", "A‚ÜíB"): "B",
         ("A", "B‚ÜíC"): "C"}

def derive(goal, premises, max_steps=10):
    frontier, visited = [set(premises)], set()
    while frontier and max_steps:
        state = frontier.pop(0)
        if goal in state:
            return state
        visited.add(frozenset(state))
        for (p1, p2), concl in rules.items():
            if p1 in state and p2 in state:
                nxt = state | {concl}
                if frozenset(nxt) not in visited:
                    frontier.append(nxt)
        max_steps -= 1
    return None

print(derive("B", {"A", "A‚ÜíB"}))
```

This *production-system* style‚Äîrules + search‚Äîbecame the backbone of **symbolic AI**, inspiring modern SMT solvers used in hardware verification.

## Hands-On Demo ‚Äì Build a 1950s-Style Chatbot

Run the following in Google Colab (`Runtime ‚Üí Run all`). It echoes the pattern-matching spirit of **ELIZA**‚Äîno ML required.

```python
"""
1950s-style therapist bot.
Type 'quit' to exit.
"""
import re, random

reflect = {"i":"you","am":"are","my":"your","me":"you",
           "you":"I","your":"my"}
def swap_pronouns(text):
    return ' '.join(reflect.get(w, w) for w in text.split())

patterns = [
    (r'.*i need (.*)',
     ["Why do you need {0}?","Would getting {0} help?"]),
    (r'.*i feel (.*)',
     ["Do you often feel {0}?","What triggers feeling {0}?"]),
    (r'hello|hi',
     ["Hello üôÇ How are you today?"]),
    (r'.*',["Tell me more.","How does that make you feel?"])
]

def reply(msg):
    for pat, resp in patterns:
        m = re.match(pat, msg.lower())
        if m:
            var = swap_pronouns(m.group(1)) if m.groups() else ''
            return random.choice(resp).format(var)

print("Therapist-Bot: Hello, how can I help?")
while True:
    user = input("> ")
    if user.lower() in {"quit","exit"}:
        break
    print("Therapist-Bot:", reply(user))
```

> **Challenge:** Add a pattern that recognises ‚Äúbecause ‚Ä¶I‚Äù explanations and probes deeper.

## Indian & Regional Threads

* **Ramanujan‚Äôs** explorations of infinite series and formal reasoning seeded a culture of mathematical rigor later echoed in Indian logic research.
* **TIFRAC**‚Äîcommissioned 1960‚Äîwas India‚Äôs first indigenous computer, based on the IAS design and boasting ferrite-core memory.([en.wikipedia.org][14])
* Today, IITs and IIIT-Hyderabad carry that torch, hosting centers for **Responsible AI** and multilingual LLM research.

## Conclusion ‚Äì Toward the Golden Age (‚âà200 words)

The six-year sprint from Turing‚Äôs philosophical puzzle to Dartmouth‚Äôs optimism birthed a discipline. By proving theorems faster than humans and coining a name that still frames billion-dollar debates, early pioneers showed that machines could manipulate symbols‚Äîideas‚Äîrather than mere numbers. Their exuberance launched the **symbolic AI boom** of the 1960s, where rule-based systems, game-playing programs, and even robots chased the dream of human-level thought.

In **Part 2** we‚Äôll enter that golden age, watching SHRDLU stack virtual blocks, ELIZA console patients, and chess programs eye grandmaster titles‚Äîuntil reality bites and the first **AI Winter** descends. Follow the series as we navigate triumph, backlash, and the relentless march toward today‚Äôs deep-learning era.
