## About the event

- Led by community member [Dr. Aviseka](https://x.com/aviseka), we have started a series of Twitter Spaces to discuss various topics in AI/ML in local Odia language.
- The discussions are conducted in Odia language and are open to all.
- The series is called Odia Twitter Spaces and is a series of discussions in Odia language.
- Peoople get to clear their doubts by askign questions to the experts of the day.
- In one of the discussions, the thought of a word game in Odia language was discussed among two members, [Dr. Aviseka](https://x.com/aviseka) and [Soumendra](www.soumendrak.com). Which resulted in creation of [Shabdarasa](https://www.shabdarasa.com), a wordle game in Odia language.
