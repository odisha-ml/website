## About the project

- Back in 2018, a few Odias come together across multiple backgrounds from all around the world to work on a project to enable Machine Translation in Odia Language.
- There were volunteers actively preparing an English-Odia parallel copus, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model development and an ecosystem to support the project.
- Odisha AI is the successor of this project.
