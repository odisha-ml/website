<!-- series_intro -->

Below is **Part 2** of our "AI Through the Ages" series—a deep-dive into the 1960s surge of symbolic, rule-driven systems that turned the Dartmouth dream into working software and hardware. You'll meet ELIZA and Shakey, implement classic algorithms in modern Python, and see how ideas from the first wave still echo in prompt engineering, formal verification, and business rule engines today. Enjoy the ride—and watch for the cracks that would usher in the first AI Winter, the focus of Part 3.

## Opening – From Dartmouth Dreams to Debuggable Code

In **1956** a handful of researchers at Dartmouth College declared that "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." That manifesto sparked optimism—but also skepticism—until the **1960s** delivered tangible proof: chatbots holding conversations, robots planning routes, and theorem provers beating human speed. This chapter explores how a **symbol-as-software** mindset—later dubbed **Good-Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI)**—captured imaginations, dominated research budgets, and laid technical cornerstones we still lean on.[^1]

---

## 1. "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (GOFAI) — 1960s Logic in Action

### 1.1 What Is Symbolic AI?

Symbolic AI represents knowledge as discrete tokens—*symbols*—and manipulates them with explicit rules. If we store the fact `is(cat, mammal)` and a rule `is(X, mammal) → warm_blooded(X)`, a deduction engine can infer `warm_blooded(cat)`. The core assumption, formalized by **Newell & Simon's Physical Symbol System Hypothesis (1963)**, is that **"intelligence = symbol manipulation."**[^1]

### 1.2 Why It Felt Obvious in the 1960s

1. **Computers already manipulated symbols**—card punches, assembly mnemonics, LISP lists—so extending that to facts and rules was natural.
2. **Hardware was scarce**; clever search and compact knowledge bases beat data-hungry methods that would not be practical until decades later.
3. Early successes in game-playing and theorem proving bolstered faith that scaling logic alone could reach human parity.[^2]

### 1.3 Programming Parallels

Symbolic AI resembles today's **AST walks** in compilers, **rule engines** like Drools, and **declarative configs** in DevOps. Where modern devs write Terraform to *declare* desired state, GOFAI researchers wrote predicate-logic rules to *declare* world knowledge.[^3] [^4]

> **Key takeaway:** GOFAI's "code = knowledge" ethos survives in any domain where we author rules rather than train weights.

## 2. Landmark Systems

### 2.1 ELIZA (1966) — A Therapist in 45 Lines

#### How It Worked

Joseph Weizenbaum's **ELIZA** at MIT parsed user input against a list of **regular-expression–like patterns** and triggered canned responses. The most famous script, *DOCTOR*, imitated Rogerian psychotherapy.[^5]

```python
# Mini-ELIZA in Python
import re, random
rules = [
    (r'I need (.*)',
     ["Why do you need {0}?", "Would it really help you to get {0}?"]),
    (r'Why don\'?t you ([^\?]*)\??',
     ["Do you really think I don't {0}?", "Perhaps eventually I will {0}."])
]
def eliza(text):
    for pat, resps in rules:
        m = re.match(pat, text, re.I)
        if m:
            return random.choice(resps).format(*m.groups())
    return random.choice(["Please go on.", "Tell me more."])
```

#### Why People Were Fooled

Users projected meaning onto generic reflections ("Tell me more about your mother"), a precursor of today's **ELIZA effect**—our tendency to see understanding where there is only pattern matching.[^5]

#### Modern Echoes

* **LLM guardrails** still wrap pattern rules around neural cores.
* ChatGPT prompt templates with `{user_input}` placeholders mirror ELIZA macros.[^6] [^7]

### 2.2 Shakey the Robot (1966-72) — Planning on Wheels

Funded by **DARPA** and built at SRI, **Shakey** was the first mobile robot that reasoned about its actions instead of just reacting.[^8]

**Architecture diagram (describe):**

1. **Sensors** (TV camera, bump detectors) fed raw data.
2. **Vision routines** produced symbolic facts like `at(box3, room2)`.
3. **STRIPS planner** searched for action sequences to satisfy goals.
4. **Actuators** executed motor commands; feedback closed the loop.[^9]

*STRIPS Planning Example (pseudo-Python):*

```python
# very simplified action schema
Action = namedtuple('Action', 'name preconds add del_')
move = Action('move', ['at(robot, R1)', 'connected(R1,R2)'],
              ['at(robot, R2)'], ['at(robot, R1)'])
```

**Impact:** STRIPS still underlies PDDL planners used by Mars rovers and warehouse bots.[^8] [^9]

## 3. Core Techniques

### 3.1 State-Space Search

Early AI treated every problem—puzzle, pathfinding, theorem—as a graph. Two evergreen algorithms emerged:

```python
from collections import deque
def bfs(start, goal_fn, neighbors):
    frontier = deque([start]); visited = {start}
    while frontier:
        state = frontier.popleft()
        if goal_fn(state): return state
        for nxt in neighbors(state):
            if nxt not in visited:
                visited.add(nxt); frontier.append(nxt)
```

Breadth-first guarantees shortest paths but explodes combinatorially; depth-first is memory-light but can dive down rabbit holes.[^10]

### 3.2 Minimax and Game Trees

Chess, checkers, and later tic-tac-toe popularized **minimax** with optional alpha-beta pruning.

```python
def minimax(board, depth, maximizing):
    if board.is_terminal() or depth==0:
        return board.eval()
    scores = [minimax(b, depth-1, not maximizing) for b in board.children()]
    return max(scores) if maximizing else min(scores)
```

This dual-perspective search inspired modern reinforcement-learning tree search in AlphaZero.[^11]

### 3.3 Rule-Based Inference Engines

Forward-chaining (IF facts → THEN add conclusions) and backward-chaining (goal-driven) engines appeared in medical advisor **MYCIN** (early 1970s). They presaged today's production BRMS like **Drools**.[^12] [^3] [^4]

## 4. Achievements and Limitations

| **What Worked (1960s)**                           | **Where It Struggled**                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Theorem proving in closed math domains             | **Combinatorial explosion**: branching factors overwhelmed even Cray-1 supercomputers.[^2] |
| Conversational illusion with ELIZA scripts         | **Brittleness**: change a keyword and logic crumbled.[^5]                                      |
| STRIPS scaled to small indoor maps                 | **Real-world noise** broke rigid symbolic models.                                                              |
| Expert rules matched human advice in micro-domains | Heuristic patches multiplied, creating maintenance nightmares.                                                 |

Researchers recognized these ceilings and, by **1973's Lighthill Report**, UK funding collapsed, foreshadowing the first **AI Winter**.[^13]

## 5. Hands-On Demo — Build an Expert System in 30 Lines

```python
# Simple forward-chaining rule engine
facts = set(["symptom:fever", "symptom:ache"])
rules = {
    ("symptom:fever", "symptom:ache"): "diagnosis:flu",
    ("symptom:fever",): "action:take_temp"
}
def infer(facts, rules):
    added = True
    while added:
        added = False
        for conds, concl in rules.items():
            if concl not in facts and all(c in facts for c in conds):
                facts.add(concl); added = True
    return facts

print(infer(facts, rules))
```

**Try These Extensions**

1. Store rules as JSON, load dynamically.
2. Add certainty factors à la MYCIN.
3. Swap out the rule base to control a game NPC—observe GOFAI crossing into modern gameplay scripting.

*Connection to the 60s:* This loop mirrors OPS5 and earlier RETE-like matchers, but Python's data structures make experimentation trivial.

## 6. Modern Connections

* **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques like chain-of-thought or plan-and-solve prompts explicitly ask an LLM to emit intermediate *symbols* before producing answers—a neo-symbolic layer on top of neural nets.[^6] [^14]
* **Business Rule Engines:** Enterprises still externalize policy in Drools or decision tables for transparency and auditability—exactly GOFAI's rationale.[^3] [^15]
* **Formal Verification:** SAT/SMT solvers prove properties of chips and protocols by manipulating symbols at scale, a direct descendant of 1960s logic.[^16] [^17]
* **Neuro-Symbolic AI:** IISc and IIT Bombay groups merge symbolic constraints with neural perception for robust reasoning—echoing Shakey's layered design.[^18] [^19]

---

## 7. Indian Context in the First Wave

* **IIT Kanpur (1963)** installed an **IBM 1620**, launching India's first structured computer science courses and symbolic programming in FORTRAN and ALGOL.[^20]
* **Tata Consultancy Services (1968)** began as Tata Computer Systems, delivering punched-card and reconciliation systems—early rule-driven automation for banks.[^21]
* Pioneering faculty sent students abroad for AI PhDs, seeding today's symbolic-reasoning labs at IITs and IISc.

## 8. Visualizing Symbolic AI Concepts

### 8.1 State-Space Search Tree

{%mermaid(invertible=true, full_width=true) %}
graph TD
    A[Start Node] --> B[Node B]
    A --> C[Node C]
    A --> D[Node D]
    B --> E[Node E]
    B --> F[Node F]
    C --> G[Node G]
    C --> H[Node H]
    D --> I[Node I]
    D --> J[Node J]
    
    classDef level0 fill:#f96;
    classDef level1 fill:#9cf;
    classDef level2 fill:#cfc;
    
    class A level0;
    class B,C,D level1;
    class E,F,G,H,I,J level2;
    
    L1["Branching Factor b = 3"] -.-> A
    L2["Depth d = 2"] -.-> J

{% end %}

*This tree shows breadth-first search progression with nodes explored level by level. The exponential growth (b^d) illustrates why early AI struggled with large search spaces.*

### 8.2 ELIZA Conversation Flow

{% mermaid(invertible=true, full_width=true) %}

    A[User Input] --> B[Pattern Matcher]
    B --> C{Highest-Score<br>Rule Selection}
    C --> D[Response Template<br>with Variables]
    D --> E[Generated Output]
    E --> A
{% end %}

*ELIZA's simple yet effective loop created conversational illusions without understanding. Modern LLM prompt templates often follow similar substitution patterns.*

### 8.3 Shakey's Reasoning Architecture

{% mermaid(invertible=true, full_width=true) %}
flowchart TD
    subgraph Perception
        A1[TV Camera] --> A[Sensor Stream]
        A2[Bump Detectors] --> A
    end
    
    A --> B[World-Model Symbols]
    B --> C[STRIPS Planner]
    C --> D[Action Queue]
    D --> E[Motor Controller]

    
    F1["at(box3, room2)"] -.-> B
    F2["move(robot, room1, room2)"] -.-> C
    
    E --> A
{% end %}

*Shakey pioneered the perception-reasoning-action loop still used in robotics. Its symbolic reasoning layer transformed raw sensor data into actionable plans.*

## Conclusion – Setting the Stage for Winter

Symbolic AI's first wave proved a computer could reason about the world, hold quasi-conversations, and even navigate hallways. It also revealed fundamental limits: exponential search, fragile rules, and the Herculean labor of knowledge encoding. As ambitions soared faster than hardware and funding, disappointment brewed—triggering the **AI Winter** of the mid-1970s. Part 3 will explore that chill, and how the field thawed by embracing probability and learning.

Until then, open your terminal, run the code samples, and experience a slice of 1960s optimism—bugs, brittleness, and all.
