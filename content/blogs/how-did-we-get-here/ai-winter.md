<!-- Series Intro -->
---
Below is **Part 3** of the "AI Through the Ages" series—an in-depth guide to the 1970 s downturn that historians now call the **first AI Winter**.  We trace the arc from bold 1960 s forecasts to funding freezes, dissect headline systems like SHRDLU and MYCIN, and let you build a bite-size expert system yourself.  Five mermaid diagrams, runnable Python files, and learning checkpoints turn history into hands-on know-how that still matters in 2025.

## 1  Introduction (1970's: From Moon-shot to Meltdown)

The 1960's closed with robots navigating corridors and chatbots charming psychologists, yet by **1974** governments were slashing grants and "artificial intelligence" had become a punch-line.  What happened?  This article unpacks broken promises, stark government reports, and the strategic pivot toward **knowledge-based expert systems** that set the stage for the 1980's boom. [^1] [^2]

---

## 2  Early Optimism Fades

### 2.1 Forecasts vs. Reality

* **1965 (Minsky):** "Within a generation … machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do." [^3]
* **1968 (Kubrick & Clarke):** *HAL 9000* promised by **1997**. [^4]
* **1970 (DARPA internal memo):** Fully-automatic battlefield assistants by **1980**. (source: DARPA anniversary mag) [^5]

None materialised: natural-language systems stalled outside labs, mobile robots hit sensor limits, and theorem provers drowned in combinatorial search.

### 2.2 The Lighthill Report (1973)

Sir **James Lighthill** submitted a blistering review to the UK Science Research Council. Key takeaways:

1. Real-world AI problems exhibit **"combinatorial explosion."**
2. Progress is "markedly slower than forecast."
3. Recommend **drastic concentration** on a handful of basic-science lines. [^6]

> **Impact:** UK funding for AI plummeted from \~£1.3 M in 1973 to £0.25 M by 1975—a >80 % cut. [^7]

### 2.3 Other Critiques

* **ALPAC Report (1966)** killed US machine-translation grants. [^8]
* **Minsky & Papert (1969)** exposed single-layer perceptron limits. [^8]

    1974 : DARPA AI ≈ $7 M
    1977 : DARPA AI ≈ $3 M
    1980 : Expert-system boom restarts funding
{% end %}

## 3  Case Study—SHRDLU & Blocks World

### 3.1 Architecture

{% end %}

### 3.2 Sample Dialogue

```
Person: Pick up a big red block.
Computer: OK.
Person: What does the box contain?
Computer: THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLUE BLOCK.
```

[^10] [^11]

### 3.3 Why It Impressed

* Integrated parsing, planning, and reasoning on a DEC PDP-6 in under 20 KB LISP.
* Demonstrated **contextual pronoun resolution** ("it" ➜ current block).

### 3.4 Critical Limits

| Strengths                              | Weaknesses                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time interaction in 1970 hardware | **Toy domain:** 15 blocks, zero noise [^12] |
| Deterministic planner                  | No sensor uncertainty                                           |
| Rule transparency                      | Hard-coded vocabulary                                           |

> **Learning Checkpoint #1**
> SHRDLU proved *possible* ≠ *scalable*. Symbolic reasoning excelled in tightly-bounded worlds, but brittle rules collapsed under real-world chaos.

## 4  The First "AI Winter"

### 4.1 Definition

An **AI Winter** is a multi-year era of dwindling funding, public trust, and researcher morale. [^2] [^8]

{% mermaid(invertible=true, full_width=true) %}
mindmap
  root((AI Winter Causes))
    Hardware Limits
      CPUs < 1 MIPS
      RAM < 1 MB
    Combinatorial Explosion
    Over-promised Timelines
    Negative Government Reports
{% end %}

*Figure 3: Interlocking factors behind the 1973-78 slump.*

### 4.2 Consequences

* **DARPA** cut "free-form" AI budgets by \~70 % between 1970-76. [^2]
* Several UK university AI labs shuttered or merged. [^7]
* Researchers re-branded as "pattern recognition" or migrated to private industry. [^8]

    title Key Winter Milestones
    1973 : Lighthill Report
    1974 : DARPA pulls back
    1976 : MIT AI Lab downsizes
    1978 : First IJCAI panel on "expert systems"
{% end %}

## 5  Knowledge-Based Pivot—Enter MYCIN

### 5.1 Stanford’s MYCIN (1974)

* \~600 **IF…THEN** rules diagnose bacterial infections.
* Achieved **65 % therapeutic acceptability vs. 62 % average human expert.** [^13] [^14]

{% mermaid(invertible=true, full_width=true) %}

    subgraph Inference Engine
        B[Backward-Chaining] --> C[Certainty Factor Combiner]
    end
    A[Rule Base] --> B
    D[Physician Q&A] --> B
    C --> E[Ranked Diagnosis + Treatment]
{% end %}

*Figure 4: MYCIN’s rule workflow.*

### 5.2 Code Skeleton

```python
IF culture=gram_neg AND site=blood THEN organism=E_coli CF 0.7
IF organism=E_coli THEN drug=Gentamicin CF 0.8
```

### 5.3 Why Domain Focus Won

* Constrained vocabulary → fewer combinatorial paths.
* Expert rules captured **human heuristics** unavailable in data form.
* Commercial ventures (credit-card fraud, mineral exploration) soon followed. ([linkedin.com][15])

> **Learning Checkpoint #2**
> Knowledge engineering traded grand universality for *depth in niches*—a template now mirrored by fine-tuned domain-LLMs.

## 6  Hands-On Demo—Build a Mini Expert System

```python
# Mini MYCIN‑style expert system
rules = [
    (["symptom:fever", "symptom:ache"], "diagnosis:flu"),
    (["symptom:fever", "symptom:cough"], "diagnosis:covid19"),
    (["diagnosis:flu"], "treatment:rest"),
    (["diagnosis:covid19"], "treatment:consult_doctor"),
]

def infer(facts):
    added = True
    facts = set(facts)
    while added:
        added = False
        for conds, concl in rules:
            if concl not in facts and all(c in facts for c in conds):
                facts.add(concl)
                added = True
    return facts

if __name__ == "__main__":
    patient_facts = ["symptom:fever", "symptom:cough"]
    print(infer(patient_facts))
```

**Step-by-Step**

1. Copy the code.
2. Add patient facts, run `python mini_expert_mycinsim.py`.
3. Extend: introduce certainty factors or store rules in JSON.

> **Try This:** Swap medical terms for network alerts to craft a rule-based NOC assistant.

## 8  Modern Echoes & Discussion

* Today’s **Rule + LLM** pipelines resemble 1970 s hybrids—rules gate outputs, LLMs supply perception.
* AI hype cycles continue (blockchain, Metaverse, GenAI). Studying winters inoculates against over-promise. ([perplexity.ai][16])
* Many safety frameworks borrow MYCIN-style explanation tools (why did the model prescribe X?). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][17])

**Discussion Questions**

1. What modern domains might suffer a "toy-world" fallacy today?
2. Could a 2025 funding pullback mirror 1974? Why or why not?
