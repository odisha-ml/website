**Odisha AI** (*aka Odias in AI/M, Odias in ML, and Odias in AI*) is a not for profit global initiative creating a space for idea sharing, fostering collaborations, and discussing initiatives to increase the presence of Odia people in the field of AI. To this end, we run mentoring programs and maintain various fora for fostering partnerships and collaborations with industry and investors.

As Utkala Gouraba Madhusudan Das‚Äôs Utkala Sammilani was created in 1903 to campaign for the unification of all Odia people into the state of Odisha. Likewise, we intend to unite all Odias in the domain of AI, across the world, under a single Odias in AI banner.
